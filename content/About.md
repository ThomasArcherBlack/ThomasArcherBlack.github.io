Hi!, I'm Thomas, a Senior at Arizona State graduating this Spring with a degree in
Biological Sciences. I am incredibly passionate about the worlds of natural resources 
and conservation. If you're interested in my previous professional experiences regarding 
these fields, please check my [experiences](/Experience/) page!

I've lived in Arizona my entire life, but I'm very excited about the potential to try out new 
places after graduating. Arizona was the perfect place for my outdoors hobies to take root, as the 
weather allowed constant backpacking and hiking trips whenever I wanted. 

In addition to my outdoors(y) hobbies, I play a lot of pickleball, being on ASU's club team for some
time. I'm also very interested in the tech world, and I am considering picking up an online M.S. in
computational biology at some point.
